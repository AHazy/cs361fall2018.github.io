Welcome to the class website for CS 361, Fall 2018.

This website has the essential information you need for the class.
All communication is done through Slack, and you can find a link to sign in in [Canvas](https://oregonstate.instructure.com/courses/1692915/assignments/syllabus).
Please read the [syllabus](/syllabus), and if you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.

All assignments are posted on canvas, and link are available [here](/assignemnts) and on the [schedule](/schedule).

Finally, the [schedule](/schedule) will contain the readings and the lectures. I'll try and post the lecture slides before class.
